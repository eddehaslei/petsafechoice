      "difference": {
        "question": "Why does the safety rating differ between dogs and cats?",

      },
      "levels": {
        "question": "What do the safety levels mean?",
        "answer": "We use three safety levels: Safe (green) means the food is generally safe for consumption in appropriate amounts. Caution (yellow) means the food may be okay in small quantities but has some risks. Dangerous (red) means the food is toxic or harmful and should be avoided completely."
